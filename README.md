## Fraud Detection Project

**Introduction**

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions. With the increasing volume of online transactions, identifying and preventing fraud has become crucial for financial institutions. This project aims to build an accurate and efficient fraud detection model using various machine learning techniques.

**Getting Started**

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/mercedesov/ml_fraud_detection.git`
`cd ml_fraud_detection`

2. Install the required dependencies

3. Download the dataset:
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1?resource=download)

**Running the Project**

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
`jupyter notebook frauds.ipynb`

Train the Model:
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Testing the Model:
Test the model on unseen data using the provided test cases in the notebook.

**Libraries and Functions Used**

The project leverages the following key libraries and functions:

***Pandas***: For data manipulation and analysis.

***NumPy***: For numerical computations.

***Scikit-learn***: For model building, training, and evaluation.

***Matplotlib/Seaborn***: For data visualization and plotting.

These libraries were chosen for their efficiency and ease of use in handling data and building machine learning models.

**Output Examples**

Throughout the notebook, you will find output examples demonstrating each step of the process, including:

***Data Visualization***: Graphs and plots showing data distribution and correlations.
***Model Performance***: Accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics evaluating the model's effectiveness.
***Predictions***: Examples of predictions made by the model on test data, highlighting its ability to detect fraudulent transactions.

**Model Results**

The final model achieves an accuracy of 1.00 and shows promising results in detecting fraudulent activities with a precision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.88. The model's predictions can be used to flag potentially fraudulent transactions for further investigation, reducing the risk of fraud.
